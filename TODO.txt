TODO for iceaddr

* iceaddr_sql for direct SQL queries to the underlying database
* Provide placenames and street names in all cases (nf, þf, þgf, ef)
* Verify that GPS coordinates are rational in DB build process
* Better automation of geo data processing in db build scripts, should not be a separate step
* iceaddr_suggest relies on comma separator to separate street address and place name. Could be made smarter.
* Function to find region of a given pair of coordinates, e.g. which_region(lat,lon) == "Norðurland"
* Add function to parse Icelandic address strings in a robust, forgiving way (see Greynir geo.py impl.)
* Add automation where package can report the last time its data was updated
* Add preposition functions from Greynir (e.g. "í Reykjavík", "á Dalvík", etc.)
* nearest_* functions should also return distance of location
* Add MANNVIRKI gpkg data from LMÍ?
* Canonical address formatting utility function?
* Tests should make sure that no entry in stadfangaskra has a postcode we're not familiar with
